### [🚀 CLICK HERE TO PLAY THE GAME](https://<otawfik>.github.io/<CosmicGame>/)

**Cosmic Explorer** is an interactive educational arcade game where you explore the solar system. Click on a planet to launch a unique mini-game based on that planet's actual scientific conditions (gravity, atmosphere, wind speed, etc.).

## 🎨 Artist's Statement
This project bridges the gap between abstract planetary data and interactive experience. By translating physical constants—like Jupiter's gravity or Neptune's wind velocity—into gameplay variables, Cosmic Explorer allows players to *feel* the hostile environments of our celestial neighbors.
